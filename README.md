Iceland-geodata
===============

A collection of geographical data for Iceland in GeoJSON and TopoJSON format.  
A special thanks to **[Sævar Öfjörð Magnússon](https://github.com/saevarom)** for helping me getting started!

1: 279,487 vertices (not simplified) GeoJSON - 12,567 KB / TopoJSON - 1,190 KB  
10: 100,455 vertices (simplified with tolerance 10) GeoJSON - 4,548 KB / TopoJSON - 668 KB  
100: 12,441 vertices (simplified with tolerance 100) GeoJSON - 564 KB / TopoJSON - 102 KB  
1000: 1,150 vertices (simplified with tolerance 1000) GeoJSON - 54 KB / TopoJSON - 12KB  

Country

1: 266,651 vertices  
10: 97,425 vertices  
100: 11,685 vertices

### Towns


Tips
----

Combining GeoJSON files to a single TopoJSON file:  
```
topojson \
-p \
-o iceland_with_towns.topo.geojson \
iceland.geojson \
towns.geojson \
```  
will make a new file `iceland_with_towns.topo.json` with two objects, `iceland` and `towns`.

[Let’s Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) - A useful article for getting started with maps in D3.js

**Adding boundaries to a map will most likely only work for the most simplified data.** This is because the junctions
between polygons must be manually corrected after simplification to match perfectly. However, it is possible to
draw outlines for all polygons (lines around whole polygons instead lines between two different polygons only).
